# climate-sentiment

Sentiment analysis on reports about climate change from tv shows Climate sentiment is a project created by me and a colleague as a part of the sneak peek phase in the organization Lumos Student Data Consulting.  
  
The task description was to do sentiment analysis on tv reports where climate change is mentioned. The results would need to be of value to the public sector.  
We calculated the positive and negative sentiment, different emotions (fear, sadness, surprise, anger, happines), found trends and patterns in data, and mapped the interaction pattern to different climate disaster events that happened in the world at that point in time.  
  
The results and the details can be found in the final-presentation.pptx and main-notebook.ipynb.
